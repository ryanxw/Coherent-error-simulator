# Coherent-error-simulator
Numpy-based quantum circuit simulator. Unitary operations only.

Errors:
1. Amplitude errors for addressed qubits (over-rotations)
2. Phase errors for addressed qubits 

Bucket list:
1. Amplitude errors for non-addressed qubits (e.g. crosstalk)
2. Phase errors for non-addressed qubits (e.g. ambient magnetic fields)
